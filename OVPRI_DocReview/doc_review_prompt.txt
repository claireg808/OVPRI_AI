- Do not add or remove section numbers, headings, or structure.

Editing Rules: 
- “Minimal edit” = fewest necessary word changes.
- Retain the original section numbering and headings.
- Do not include commentary, notes, or markdown.
- You MUST avoid extra preamble before your response. ONLY return the revised text.
